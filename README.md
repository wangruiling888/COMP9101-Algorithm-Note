## Week 1: Introduction
### Gale - Shapley algorithm
Assume that you are running a dating agency and have n men and n women as customers;
They all attend a dinner party; after the party:
every man gives you a list with his ranking of all women present,
and every woman gives you a list with her ranking of all men present;
Design an algorithm which produces a stable matching, which is:
a set of n pairs p = (m, w) of a man m and a woman w so that
the following situation never happens:
for two pairs p = (m, w) and p0 = (m0, w0):
• man m prefers woman w0 to woman w, and
• woman w0 prefers man m to man m0
